                    World War II (often abbreviated as WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved many of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.

                    The war was marked by significant events, including the Holocaust, the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the establishment of the United Nations. World War II resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.

                    The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. The Allies eventually prevailed, but not before immense suffering and destruction had occurred.

                    World War II had profound and lasting effects on the world. It led to the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers and the beginning of the Cold War. The war also accelerated the decolonization of Africa and Asia and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the European Union.
