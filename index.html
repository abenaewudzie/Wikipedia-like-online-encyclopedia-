						<h2>World War II</h2>
						<div class="entry-content">
							<p>
								World War II (often abbreviated as WWII or WW2), also known as
								the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to
								1945. It involved many of the world's countries, including all
								of the great powers, organized into two opposing military
								alliances: the Allies and the Axis.
							</p>

							<p>
								The war was marked by significant events, including the
								Holocaust, the use of nuclear weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
								and the establishment of the United Nations. World War II
								resulted in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, making it
								the deadliest conflict in human history.
							</p>

							<p>
								The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial,
								and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the
								distinction between civilian and military resources. The Allies
								eventually prevailed, but not before immense suffering and
								destruction had occurred.
							</p>

							<p>
								World War II had profound and lasting effects on the world. It
								led to the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union
								as superpowers and the beginning of the Cold War. The war also
								accelerated the decolonization of Africa and Asia and laid the
								groundwork for the establishment of the European Union.
